    "In this part of the project, the goal is to build an interactive map of Europe that allows users to explore key information about major European cities. The task combines web scraping, data integration, and geospatial visualization to create an informative and interactive tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Scrape the geographical coordinates of each city directly from the Wikipedia Main Page, ensuring accuracy and consistency with the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Match the scraped coordinates with the dataset entries so that each city is correctly assigned to its corresponding country, population, average salary, and cost of living.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Use the cleaned and enriched dataset to construct an interactive map of Europe, where each city can be clicked or hovered over to display its relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, we will have a fully functional map that visually represents European cities and provides meaningful insights through an intuitive interface. This builds on the skills developed earlier in the project and introduces new concepts in geospatial data handling and visualization."
